# MC-Status-Discord-Bot
This discord bot is designed to check status of MC servers. It is a really basic bot with few commands, maybe I will impliment more
commands later.

##Documentation
This discord bot has *two* commands none of which are case sensitive:
* ```!hello```
* ```!status```

###!hello
The command is just ```!hello```

###!status
The command is ```!status [ip]```. Write the Minecraft's Server IP after the command to pass is as an argument to the bot.
